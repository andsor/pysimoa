    abstract = {In a comprehensive study of methods for mitigating the problem of the initial transient, Hoad et al (2009) conclude that {MSER} (White, 1997) is an efficient, effective, and robust truncation rule, appropriate for automation. Franklin and White (2008) suggest that {MSER} works because it minimizes an approximation to the mean-squared error in the estimated steady-state mean; Franklin et al (2009) offer empirical support for this suggestion. In this paper, we use the example of an {M/M}/1 queue to provide a clear restatement of initialization problem in both the time and frequency domains, distinguishing between the biasing effects of initialization and autocorrelation. We demonstrate that mitigating initialization bias is not a matter of determining the most representative initial condition per se and that minimum mean-squared error is a more appropriate objective. This demonstration also argues against the efficiency of the replication/deletion approach to output analysis.},

Conversely, this comparison also lets us explore whether or not a stationarity test from the time-series literature can be used as an effective initialization bias-control heuristic.

@inproceedings{White2000Comparison,
    abstract = {We compare the performance of five well-known truncation heuristics for mitigating the effects of initialization bias in the output analysis of steady-state simulations. Two of these rules are variants of the {MSER} heuristic studied by White (1997); the remaining rules are adaptations of bias-detection tests based on the seminal work of Schruben (1982). Each heuristic was tested in each of a 168 different experiments. Each experiment comprised multiple tests on different realizations of the sample path of a second-order autoregressive process with known (deterministic) bias function. Different experiments employed alternative process parameters, generating a range of damped and underdamped stochastic responses. These were combined with alternative damped, underdamped, and mean shift bias functions. The performance of each rule was evaluated based on the ability of the rule to remove bias from the mean estimator for the steady-state process. Results confirmed that four of the five rules were effective and reliable, consistently yielding truncated sequences with reduced bias. In general, the {MSER} heuristics outperformed the three rules based on bias detection, with Spratt's (1998) {MSER}-5 the most effective and robust choice for a general-purpose method.},

    abstract = {The start-up or warm-up problem arises in steady-state, discrete-event simulation, where the arbitrary selection of initial conditions introduces bias in simulated output sequences. In this paper, we develop and test a new truncation heuristic or resolving the start-up problem. Given a finite sequence, the truncation rule deletes initial observations until the width of the marginal confidence interval about the truncated sample mean is minimized. This rule is easy to implement, has strong intuitive appeal, and is remarkably effective in mitigating initialization bias. We illustrate the performance of the heuristic by comparison with enhanced implementations of alternative truncation rules proposed in the literature. All rules are applied to output sequences generated by ten runs each of four representative queuing simulations. Results confirm the significance of the start-up problem and demonstrate that simple truncation heuristics can solve this problem. All of the rules tested are shown to provide improved accuracy without undue loss of precision. We conclude that all four of the rules tested represent attractive solutions to the start-up problem.},

We assume a fixed-length simulation-generated time series from which point and confidence-interval ({CI}) estimators of the steady-state mean are sought. {MSER}-5 uses the data-truncation point that minimizes the half-length of the usual batch-means {CI} computed from the truncated data set. {N-Skart} uses a randomness test to determine the data-truncation point beyond which spaced batch means are approximately independent of each other and the simulation's initial condition; then using truncated nonspaced batch means, {N-Skart} exploits separate adjustments to the {CI} half-length that account for the effects on the distribution of the underlying Student's t-statistic arising from skewness and autocorrelation of the batch means. In most of the test problems, {N-Skart}'s point estimator had smaller bias than that of {MSER}-5; moreover in all cases, {N-Skart}'s {CI} estimator outperformed that of {MSER}-5.},

@article{Hoad2009Automating,

The first is the removal of any initialisation bias, the second is ensuring that enough output data is produced to obtain an accurate estimate of performance. This paper is concerned with the first issue, and more specifically warm-up estimation. Our aim is to produce an automated procedure, for inclusion into commercial simulation software, for estimating the length of warm-up and hence removing initialisation bias from simulation output data. This paper describes the extensive literature search that was carried out in order to find and assess the various existing warm-up methods, the process of short-listing and testing of candidate methods. In particular it details the extensive testing of the warm-up {MSER}-5 method.},

    abstract = {The problem addressed in this chapter is one of testing whether a sequence of random variables x 1,â¦,x  n  are independent based on a set of observations x 1, â¦, x n  of these random variables. One approach to this problem is to make an assumption about the distribution of the x i , both when they are independent and under the alternative that they are not independent, and test one hypothesis against the other. The simplest such pair of assumptions is that the x i  are identically distributed as N(0, Ï2) random variables and, in the case of dependence, that the dependence can be modeled as a first-order auto-regressive series wherein  \$\$\begin{gathered} {{x}\_{1}} = {{u}\_{1}}, \hfill \\ {{x}\_{i}} = \rho {{x}\_{{i - 1}}} + {{u}\_{i}},i = 2, \ldots ,n, \hfill \\ \end{gathered}\$\$  and the u i  are independent N(0, Ï2) random variables. The case Ï = 0 corresponds to the case in which the x i  are independent N(0, Ï2) random variables. Under the alternative hypothesis, C(x i , x i ) = Ï |i â j| and V x i  = Ï2(1 + Ï + â¦ + Ï i â 1)= Ï2(1 â Ï i )/(1 â Ï), so that the x i  are not even identically distributed. Section 1 studies tests of this and more complex autoregressive models as alternatives to independence, both for a sequence of observations and for regression residuals.},
